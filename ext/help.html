		<h2>Opening and Closing the MovieCleaner dialog</h2>
		<p>When a movie on a supported site (currently Netflix and Amazon) is opened, MovieCleaner starts automatically and opens the main MovieCleaner Dialog.</p>

		<p class="instructions">
			To close the dialog, do one of the following:
			<ul>
				<li>
					If you are being presented with a choice in the main message area of the dialog (such as choosing whether to use a filter or not) choose "Ok" or "Cancel".
					<img class="detail" src="/icons/OkandCancelBtn.png">
				</li>
				<li>
					Click the <span class="MCClose">❭❭</span> button in the upper right corner of the MovieCleaner dialog.<br/> Note that if there are currently buttons in the message area of the dialog, clicking this will essentially put that choice on hold.
					<img class="detail" src="/icons/HideBtn.png">
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p class="instructions">
			To re-open the dialog:
			<ul>
				<li>Click MovieCleaner's extension icon in the row of extension icons to the right of the browser's address bar.
				<img class="detail" src="/icons/ExtensionIcon.png"></li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h2>Pausing and Unpausing your Video</h2>
		<p>Whenever the main MovieCleaner Dialog opens, the video you are watching is paused. Whenever the dialog is closed, the video returns to playing.</p>
